### Anomaly baised Intrusion Detection System using one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network 
As technologies in information and virtualization evolve, the volume of security threats attempting to cause damage to systems
grows and becomes more powerful, which highlights the importance of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to have an essential role
in network security and help in detecting malicious attacks from network traffic. The most widely used network anomaly detection
systems are based on machine learning (ML) techniques such as decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest
neighbor (KNN). Although IDSs based on ML techniques have achieved promising results and high detection rates, however, it is
considered a type of shallow learning that depends mainly on feature engineering and requires large-scale data pre-processing as the
size of the dataset grows. To overcome these problems, Deep learning-based IDSs are proposed because they have a better ability
to extract features from huge amounts of data. In this research, an IDS model based on one-dimensional Convolution Neutron
Network (CNN1D) is proposed that is able to detect anomalies with accuracy of 93.2% and F1-score of 93.1%. Entire NSL-KDD
benchmark dataset was used to train this model. Achieved results are then compared to Deep Learning (DL) methods like CNN,
LSTM, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and others to prove the proposed modelâ€™s superiority.
